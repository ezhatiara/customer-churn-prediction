**Customer Churn Prediction**

This project, part of Binar Academy's Data Science Bootcamp, focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. By analyzing historical data and employing machine learning models, we aim to identify patterns and factors contributing to customer attrition. Our goal is to develop predictive models that assist the company in proactively addressing churn and retaining valuable customers.
